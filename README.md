## About

I'm originally from the San Francisco Bay Area. I did my undergrad work at Amherst College in Massachusett's Pioneer Valley, where I majored in Biology. I've done fieldwork in Costa Rica, Bhutan, Italy, Maryland, and Massachusetts (mostly in mountain landscapes). Before starting my PhD I spent a year in Peru's lowland Amazon, working with undergraduates interested in environmental science and biology! Now my home is at the Eaton lab in New York City! I love cooking, playing scrabble, and hiking. 

## Research

My research focuses on the evolutionary history and consequences of biotic interactions, using plant systems as models. I use bioinformatics and phylogenmics as tools to answer broader questions about coevolutionary phenomena. I currently work with plants in the genus *Pedicularis*, which parasitize a broad range of host plants, including grasses and sedges.
